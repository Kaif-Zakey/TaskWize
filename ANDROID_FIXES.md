# Android Login Persistence & Location Monitoring Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Data Not Persisting on Android

**Problem**: User authentication not persisting after app restart on Android devices.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced Firebase auth configuration to ensure proper persistence
- Firebase automatically persists auth state in React Native, but proper initialization order is crucial
- Removed manual AsyncStorage auth handling that could conflict with Firebase's persistence

**Files Modified**: `firebase.ts`

### 2. Location Monitoring Not Working After App Restart

**Problem**: Tasks with location settings weren't triggering notifications after app restart because:

- Location monitoring initialized before user authentication
- Existing tasks with location settings weren't restored to monitoring
- Missing task restoration logic when user logs in

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Fixed Initialization Order

- Removed location monitoring initialization from app startup
- Added location monitoring initialization to AuthContext when user logs in
- Ensures service only starts when user is authenticated

**Files Modified**: `app/_layout.tsx`, `context/AuthContext.tsx`

#### B. Added Task Restoration Logic

- Created `restoreTasksFromFirebase()` method in LocationMonitoringService
- Automatically loads all pending tasks with location settings when user logs in
- Restores tasks to location monitoring without requiring manual re-setup

**Files Modified**: `service/locationMonitoringService.ts`

#### C. Enhanced Background Task Logging

- Added detailed logging to background location task
- Better error reporting for debugging location monitoring issues
- Enhanced proximity checking with more informative logs

### 3. Missing Debug Tools

**Problem**: Difficult to diagnose authentication and location issues on Android.

**Solution**: Added debug functionality in Settings:

- Auth persistence debug button
- Shows Firebase auth state, AsyncStorage data, and location monitoring status
- Helps identify specific issues with persistence or location monitoring

**Files Modified**: `app/(dashboard)/settings.tsx`

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow:

1. User logs in → Firebase auth state changes
2. AuthContext detects authentication → Initializes location monitoring
3. LocationMonitoringService.restoreTasksFromFirebase() runs
4. All pending tasks with location settings are restored to monitoring
5. Background location monitoring starts tracking

### Location Notification Flow:

1. Background task runs every 30 seconds or 50 meters movement
2. Checks proximity to all tracked pending tasks
3. When user is within range of incomplete task:
   - Plays immediate sound alert (if sound effects enabled)
   - Sends notification
   - Removes task from monitoring to prevent spam

### Debug Tools:

- **Test Location Monitoring**: Tests the location monitoring system
- **Debug Auth Persistence**: Shows detailed auth and storage status
- Both available in Settings → Debug & Testing section

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Initialization Order**: Location monitoring now waits for authentication
2. **Task Restoration**: Existing tasks automatically restored to monitoring
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging information for troubleshooting
4. **Debug Tools**: Built-in tools to diagnose auth and location issues
5. **Reliable Background Processing**: Improved background task error handling

## Testing Instructions

1. **Login Persistence Test**:
   - Login to app
   - Close app completely
   - Reopen app → Should stay logged in

2. **Location Monitoring Test**:
   - Create task with location and enable notifications
   - Close app and reopen
   - Go to Settings → Debug Auth Persistence → Verify tasks are restored
   - Move near task location → Should receive sound notification

3. **Debug Information**:
   - Use "Debug Auth Persistence" button to check auth status
   - Use "Test Location Monitoring" to verify location service
   - Check console logs for detailed information

## Files Modified Summary

- `firebase.ts` - Improved auth persistence configuration
- `context/AuthContext.tsx` - Added location monitoring initialization on login
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Removed premature location monitoring initialization
- `service/locationMonitoringService.ts` - Added task restoration and enhanced logging
- `app/(dashboard)/settings.tsx` - Added debug tools

The fixes address both the login persistence issue and ensure location monitoring works reliably after app restarts.

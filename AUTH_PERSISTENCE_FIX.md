# Authentication Persistence Fix

## 🔧 Problem Solved

**Issue:** Users were getting logged out after closing and reopening the app multiple times, despite Firebase authentication being configured.

**Root Cause:** Firebase v12 in React Native sometimes needs additional persistence mechanisms and token refresh handling to maintain long-term authentication state.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Firebase Configuration (`firebase.ts`)

- Added AsyncStorage integration for additional session tracking
- Implemented automatic token storage on auth state changes
- Added session cleanup on logout

```typescript
// Store auth state in AsyncStorage for additional persistence
auth.onAuthStateChanged(async (user) => {
  if (user) {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem("userToken", await user.getIdToken());
    await AsyncStorage.setItem("userId", user.uid);
  } else {
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem("userToken");
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem("userId");
  }
});
```

### 2. Improved Auth Service (`authService.ts`)

**New Features:**

- ✅ Enhanced login with session data storage
- ✅ Session validation function
- ✅ Automatic session refresh mechanism
- ✅ Complete session cleanup on logout

**Key Functions:**

- `validateSession()` - Checks if current session is valid
- `setupSessionRefresh()` - Automatically refreshes tokens
- Enhanced `login()` and `logout()` with AsyncStorage management

### 3. Robust AuthContext (`AuthContext.tsx`)

**Improvements:**

- ✅ Session restoration check on app start
- ✅ Token validation with forced refresh
- ✅ Better error handling for invalid sessions
- ✅ Automatic session cleanup on authentication failure

### 4. Root Layout Integration (`_layout.tsx`)

- ✅ Automatic session refresh setup on app start
- ✅ Proper cleanup of session listeners

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Login Process:

1. User logs in with email/password
2. Firebase authentication succeeds
3. Token and user data stored in AsyncStorage
4. Session refresh mechanism activated

### App Restart Process:

1. Firebase automatically restores session
2. AuthContext checks stored session data
3. Token is validated and refreshed if needed
4. User remains logged in without re-authentication

### Session Maintenance:

1. Automatic token refresh on auth state changes
2. Session validation before critical operations
3. Graceful session cleanup if validation fails

## 📱 User Experience

**Before Fix:**

- Login ✅
- Close app, reopen ✅ (still logged in)
- Close app, reopen ❌ (needs to login again)

**After Fix:**

- Login ✅
- Close app, reopen ✅ (still logged in)
- Close app, reopen ✅ (still logged in)
- Close app, reopen ✅ (still logged in)
- **Stays logged in until explicit logout** ✅

## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ Automatic token refresh prevents expired sessions
- ✅ Session validation before critical operations
- ✅ Complete session cleanup on logout
- ✅ Graceful handling of invalid/expired tokens

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Basic Persistence:** Login → Close app → Reopen (should stay logged in)
2. **Multiple Closures:** Repeat close/reopen 5+ times (should stay logged in)
3. **Long-term Storage:** Login → Wait 1 hour → Reopen (should stay logged in)
4. **Network Issues:** Login → Disconnect internet → Reconnect → Reopen (should stay logged in)
5. **Explicit Logout:** Logout → Close app → Reopen (should need to login)

### Debug Logs:

- `✅ User session stored to AsyncStorage` - Session saved
- `🔄 Session refreshed automatically` - Token refreshed
- `✅ User session is valid` - Session validation passed
- `🔄 User session restored from Firebase persistence!` - Session restored

## 🚀 Build Instructions

The authentication persistence is now fixed. Build your app:

```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **AsyncStorage Backup:** App now uses both Firebase persistence AND AsyncStorage for double redundancy
2. **Token Refresh:** Tokens are automatically refreshed to prevent expiration
3. **Session Validation:** Each session is validated before use
4. **Graceful Degradation:** If session becomes invalid, it's gracefully cleaned up

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If users still experience logout issues:

1. Check device storage space (AsyncStorage needs space)
2. Verify network connectivity during app usage
3. Check console logs for session validation errors
4. Ensure Firebase project has proper configuration

The authentication persistence should now work reliably across multiple app restarts and extended periods of inactivity.
